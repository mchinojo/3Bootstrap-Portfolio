# Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

On my previous challenge I had to build a portfolio page, using some skills Iâ€™ve recently learned, like flexbox, girds, media queries and CSS variables. This time, I have to recreate this portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. 
I will use some of the Bootstrap components, like a Navigation bar, a Jumbotron, Cards on a grid, Lists, a contact Form and a Footer.
